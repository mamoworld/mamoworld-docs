# Logic

## Overview 

Logic blocks are about yes/no questions. Is this project item a sequence? Has this clip been used in a sequence at least once? In programming languages, these kinds of questions can be formulated with (boolean) logic and the answer to the question is either the value `true` (for yes) or `false` (for no).

In Automation Blocks, logic values have pointed edges - in contrast to texts or numbers, which have rounded edges:

So whenever you see these pointed shapes, you know that a logic value (or yes/no question) is expected at that point.


## If {#controls_if}

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockScreenshots/Logic/controls_if.png" alt="Block controls_if"/>


The *if* block is the the most essential block in the logic category. Whereas all other logic blocks are about formulating logic questions, the *if* block is about what should actually be done if the answer to the question is yes (or what else should be done when the answer is no).

At the top of the *if* block, you need to insert a logic value, aka a yes/no question, and the blocks you plug inside the if block are only executed if the answer to this question is yes (i.e. `true`). This example writes `the sequence has markers` to the console if the active sequence has at least one marker (and otherwise does nothing):

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockOther/controls_if_example_1.png" alt="Block shapes"/>


### If ... Else {#controls_if_else_1}

When you click on the blue cogwheel icon on the top left of the *if* block, you can also add an *else* section too. The *else* section will only be executed if the answer to the question is no (i.e. `false`). Let's extend our example so it outputs `the sequence has NO markers` if the sequences does NOT have at least one marker:

<Anigif src={useBaseUrl('/img/blockOther/if_else_example.gif')} />

### If ... Else If ... Else


Finally, you can have an *if* block that asks multiple questions by adding *else if* sections to the block. When the answer to the first question is `false` (and only in that case), it does not go to the *else* block immediately, but first asks the second question. Here is an example:

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockOther/controls_if_example_2.png" alt="Block shapes"/>


This example checks the type of the project item with name `my item name`. The *if* block executes exactly one of the "write to console" blocks in order to state what type the project item actually is.


## Compare {#logic_compare}

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockScreenshots/Logic/logic_compare.png" alt="Block logic_compare"/>


This block can compare two numbers. Use it to ask questions like "Are the numbers equal?" or "Is the first number greater than the second number?".

### Example: Has Footage been used?

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockOther/logic_compare_example.png" alt="Block logic_compare"/>


Here we use the Compare block to ask if a footage item has been used at least once ("Is the number of times the footage item has been used greater or equal to one?"):


## And/Or {#logic_operation}

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockScreenshots/Logic/logic_operation.png" alt="Block logic_operation"/>


With this block you can combine two questions into one. If you choose "and", the result is only `true` if both questions are answered with `true`. For "or" the result is `true` if at least one of the two questions is answered with `true`.

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockOther/logic_operation_example.png" alt="or example"/>


This example returns `true` if either the video or the audio of the footage item (or both audio and video) has been used at least once.

## Not {#logic_negate}

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockScreenshots/Logic/logic_negate.png" alt="Block logic_negate"/>


This block turns a `true` into a `false` and vice versa.

### Example: End of Textfile

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockOther/logic_negate_example.png" alt="or example"/>


The [End of File](filesText.mdx#extendscript_text_file_eof) block returns `true` if the script has read the entire contents of the text file already. If you plug it into a *Not* block, it returns `true` if there is still content left to read.

## Boolean (Logic Value){#logic_boolean}

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockScreenshots/Logic/logic_boolean.png" alt="Block logic_boolean"/>


This block always returns `true` or always returns `false` (depending on which of the two you have chosen in the dropdown).

## Checkbox{#block_checkbox}

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockScreenshots/Logic/block_checkbox.png" alt="Block block_checkbox"/>

This block is identical to the normal boolean block, just with a different visual representation. If the checkbox is checked, it has the value `true` and otherwise `false`.

## Null {#logic_null}

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockScreenshots/Logic/logic_null.png" alt="Block logic_null"/>


The JavaScript value [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null), which represents the intentional absense of any object value.
You can also use Null directly in a logic test (as the condition of an [if block](logic.mdx#controls_if), for example). In a logic test, Null will behave like `false` whereas any other object behaves like `true`. For example, see the [Ternary Test](logic.mdx#logic_ternary) below.


## Ternary Test {#logic_ternary}

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockScreenshots/Logic/logic_ternary.png" alt="Block logic_ternary"/>


This block is similar to an [if...else](logic.mdx#controls_if_else_1) statement. The difference is the following: with the *if...else* block, you can plug in two block stacks (where one block stack is executed when the condition is `true` and the other when the condition is `false`). In the *Ternary Test* you plug in two values instead of two block stacks and the first value is returned if the condition is `true` and the second is returned if the value is `false`. In other words, this is a mini-version of the *if....else* block that is just about calculating a single value instead of executing arbitrary blocks.

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockOther/logic_ternary_example_simple.png" alt="simple ternary example"/>


In this example, the block on the left returns `first text` whereas the block on the right returns `second text`.

### Example: null and markers

This script prints on the console `first sequence marker is at 5 seconds` if the active sequence has its first marker at that time and if the active sequence has no marker, it prints `sequence has no marker` instead.

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockOther/logic_ternary_example_complex.png" alt="Complex ternary and null example"/>


In the first line, we save the first marker of the active sequence in the [variable](variables.mdx) `my marker`. If the sequence has no marker, we give the variable the value `null` instead, to indicate that there is no such marker object.

When we want to use the marker, we need to first check if the marker actually exists or is `null`. To do this, we test the `my marker` variable in an *if* block. Since `null` is equivalent to `false` (whereas any other object, like a valid marker, is equivalent to to `true`), the first *write to console* block is only executed if a marker exists, and otherwise the second one only.
