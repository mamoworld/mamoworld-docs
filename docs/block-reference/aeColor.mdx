# Ae Color

## Color values returned by blocks

Blocks return label colors as hex strings (like #ff0000 for red), but color values of properties as a [list](lists.mdx) of four numbers in the range 0 to 1 (representing, r,g,b,a such that `[1,0,0.5,1]` is 100% red, 0% green, 50% blue)

## Specifying Time Values

If you need to pass a time value as an argument to a block, you can specify it in one of the following formats:

- hex string (like #ff0000 or short form #f00)
-  a [list](lists.mdx) of three numbers in the range 0 to 1 (representing, r,g,b, such that `[1,0,0.5]` is 100% red, 0% green, 50% blue)
- a color name like `red`, `sandstone`. In addition to the default label color names of Ae, also css color names like `aliceblue` are supported.
