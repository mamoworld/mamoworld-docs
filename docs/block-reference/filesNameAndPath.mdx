# Files Name & Path

Files (and also Folders) in Automation Blocks are just texts representing the full path of the file.
The following blocks will help you to manipulate these paths, which is very helpful for creating new filenames, renaming files, etc. 

The blocks have been created to manipulate file paths, but of course they work on any text - so you can also use them to manipulate other texts, too.

## Replace In File Path {#block_extendscript_file_path_replace_part}

A file path like `path/to/myFile001.png` consists of different sections:
- the folder `path/to`
- the name `myFile`
- the numbers `001` 
- the extension `.png`

With this block, you can replace any of these parts with something new.

When you replace the suffix and your new suffix does not have a dot at the beginning, the block will add one automatically. So, it doesn't matter if you use `jpg`or `.jpg` as the new suffix, for example. In the same way, if you replace the path, it does not matter if your path ends with a `/` (or `\`) or not, since the block will add one if needed.


## Tinker File Path {#string_tinker_path}

This block is your Swiss army knife when it comes to manipulating a file path. It's like an advanced version of the [Replace in File Path block](filesNameAndPath.mdx#block_extendscript_file_path_replace_part). It decomposes a file path into its ingredients - like splitting `/path/to/myFile001.jpg` into `/path/to`,`/`, `myFile`, `001` and `.jpg`. You can then recombine those parts however you like. 

The block extracts the following parts from the path:

- **$FOLDER** the folder where the file is located.
- **$NAME** the name of the file without numbers at the end (if the file is part of an image sequence, for example) and without the extension
- **$NUMBERS** the numbers at the end of the filename (for an image sequence, for example). If the filename has no numbers at the end, this is empty.
- **$EXT** The file extension, i.e. the suffix like `.mp4`or `.mov` including the dot.
- **$SEP** the separator symbol used in the path - either `/` or `\`.

The block allows you to combine these parts again in whatever way you want by specifying a pattern.

The example above turns the file name `path/to/my/file012.jpg` into the result `path/to/my/file_now_png_00012.png`, for example.

#### number of digits in $NUMBERS

You can change the number of digits in `$NUMBERS` by adding the number of desired digits in square brackets.
So if `$NUMBERS` is `0123`, for example, then `$NUMBERS[5]` is `00123`, resulting in 5 digits. This function only adds or removes zeros, but no other digits, so `$NUMBERS[1]` will give `123` and not `3`.

#### parent folders

For `$FOLDER` you can go up the parenting chain by adding the number of levels you want to go up in square brackets. 
So if `$FOLDER` is `C:\path\to\my` then `$FOLDER[1]` is `C:\path\to` and `$FOLDER[2]` is `C:\path`.

#### More Examples

The following block constructs a new path from the project file path pointing to a folder `footage`, which is a sibling of the folder where the project is created.

<RetinaImg src="/img/blockOther/string_tinker_path_example.png" alt="Project File Example"/>


So if the project is `C:\my\project\pr\myproject.prproj`, for example, then the result is `C:\my\project\footage`

## Text Pattern {#string_pattern}

The Text Pattern block is very useful for creating file paths, but also for all kinds of other strings. For this reason, it's [documented in the Text category](text.mdx#string_pattern).
