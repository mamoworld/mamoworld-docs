# Categories: Finding the Blocks You Need


You've completed [your First Automation Hero Class](firstSteps) and written your first script, but to be honest, we cheated a little bit: I told you which blocks you need to use and where to find them. Of course, grown-up superheroes need to know which blocks to use and where to find them. I could just say "Please read the [in depth block reference](../block-reference/text) for details about all available blocks", but I have to admit that this is about as entertaining as learning all the entries in a phone book by heart. 

The good news is that you don't need to know every single block - you just need to know where to find the blocks for each topic. And this means you need to understand the categories that the blocks are grouped into. Therefore, I want to encourage you to  to read the [Overview](../block-reference/overview) of the block reference. The overview is your walk around the zoo - at the end of the tour, you won't know each individual animal, but you will know that you have to go to the reptile house when you're looking for a snake.

[Read the Overview of the Block Reference!](../block-reference/overview)

After you read the block Overview you've got a better idea of what kind of blocks Automation Blocks has to offer. But to get used to working with those blocks, you'll need some practice. Therefore, in the next tutorial you'll get some hands-on experience again, while we create a [block script to search & replace in project items](searchReplaceProjectItems.mdx).
