# Categories: Finding the Blocks You Need


Of course, grown-up Automation Blocks superheroes need to know which blocks to use and where to find them. The good news is that you don't need to know every single block - you just need to know where to find the blocks for each topic. And this means you need to understand the categories that the blocks are grouped into. Therefore, I want to encourage you to  to read the [Overview](../block-reference/overview) of the block reference. 

The overview is your walk around the zoo - at the end of the tour, you won't know each individual animal, but you will know that you have to go to the reptile house when you're looking for a snake.
