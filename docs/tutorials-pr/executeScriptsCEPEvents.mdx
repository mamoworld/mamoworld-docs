# Execute Scripts with CEP Events

You can also remote-execute Automation Blocks scripts from other  extensions (CEP panels). If you develop your own extensions, there is no need to reinvent the wheel: Just use Automation Blocks inside your own extensions and speed up your development.

## Run Script File

To execute an Automation Blocks script, just send the event `com.aescripts.AutomationBlocksPr.runScriptFile` and provide as data the path of the xml file containing the block script you want to execute.

```
// execute script test.xml without loading it into the UI
var event = new CSEvent('com.aescripts.AutomationBlocksPr.runScriptFile', 'APPLICATION');
event.data = "/path/to/file/test.xml";
new CSInterface().dispatchEvent(event);
```
In order to make this work, Automation Blocks needs to be installed (and licensed) on the machine, but the Automation Blocks user interface does not need to be open.

If you run into any issues open http://localhost:2029/ with Chrome to see the debugger of the Automation Blocks API. Its console will contain helpful messages.

:::danger Input Blocks Limitation

Since this event executes the block scripts without a user interface, it fails for block scripts which contain an [input block](../block-reference/userInterfaceAndComments.mdx#input_arg). If you need user input, use the other user interface blocks, which create popup dialogs.

:::

##  Run Current Script

If the user interface of Automation Blocks is open in Premiere Pro, you can also ask it to run the tool, which is currently open in the UI:
```
// run the script that is currently open in the Automation Blocks UI
var event = new CSEvent('com.aescripts.AutomationBlocksPr.runCurrentScript', 'APPLICATION');
new CSInterface().dispatchEvent(event);
```

This event is handled by the panel showing the Automation Blocks UI. Hence, it only works if the Automation Blocks UI is open.
For debugging open the Automation Blocks panel at http://localhost:2026/.


##  Load Script File

If the user interface of Automation Blocks is open in Premiere Pro, you can also tell it to open a block script of your choice in the user interface:

```
// load the block script test.xml into the Automation. Blocks UI
var event = new CSEvent('com.aescripts.AutomationBlocksPr.loadScriptFile', 'APPLICATION');
event.data = "/path/to/file/test.xml";
new CSInterface().dispatchEvent(event);
```

This event is handled by the panel showing the Automation Blocks UI. Hence, it only works if the Automation Blocks UI is open.
For debugging open the Automation Blocks panel at http://localhost:2026/.
