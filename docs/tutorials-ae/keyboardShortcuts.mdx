## Hotkeys and Other Triggers in Pr + Ae

While the method shown here only works in After Effects,  there is also a second method to trigger Automation Blocks scripts with keyboard shortcuts both in Ae and Pr. With this alternative method yo cannot just trigger your scripts using hotkeys, but also from any external sources, like your phone, external devices or other software.
