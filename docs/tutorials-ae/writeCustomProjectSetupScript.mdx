# Write Your Custom Project Setup Script

Learn how to write your own tools with Automation Blocks - no programming skills required!

In this course you will create your own custom project setup script. It will do all the tedious tasks for you, which always need to be done when you start a new project. And since everybody's workflow is different, you learn how to write this tool yourself - and how to tailor it exactly to your own needs.

Here are some of the things that our *Project Setup Script* will be capable of:
- Ask you for the project name.
- Create a project folder on your harddrive.
- Create a new Ae project in that folder.
- Create your favorite bin structure in the project panel.
- Check if your camera's memory card is mounted and if so copy all footage from the card to the project folder and import it into the project.
- Create a main composition with guides and a background shape layer.

Most likely in your workflow you just need some of these features, but since we will create the script together from start to finish, you can cherry-pick exactly the parts you need. And even better: The skills you learn in this course will enable you to also write any other kinds of tools with Automation Blocks.

If you want to follow along but don't want to write the block code yourself, you also find the block code in our [Community Library](intro.mdx#access-community-library) in the folder `Courses/Write Your Custom Project Setup Script`.

### Class 1: Getting Started and Creating Project Bins

<Youtube id="ZI889pJlJt0"/>


In this class we get started with writing our own Automation Blocks scripts. We'll write a script that creates a new Ae project and some project bins, as well as giving a quick overview of the available blocks and learn where to find their documentation.

### Class 2: Creating a Basic UI and System Folders

<Youtube id="RYKp-AMKNzM"/>


In this class, we extend our script so that it prompts the user for a project name. The script then saves the project using that name, and also sets up a folder structure for us.
On the technical side, you'll learn how to work with texts, file paths and also how to use variables.

### Class 3: Copying Files and Working with "If" Blocks

<Youtube id="Rg2IhWxOiUs"/>

In this class we extend our script such that it checks if the memory card of our camera is currently mounted. If this is the case, it copies all footage files from the camera to our project folder. Of course, you can use this method also to copy files from USB sticks or other locations.

On the technical side, you learn how to work with *if blocks* and logic values in Automation Blocks. These allow you to execute some part of your script only under certain conditions (like only if the memory card is mounted, or only if the active composition has a particular resolution, for example).

### Class 4: Importing Files and Syncing Entire Folders

<Youtube id="4R7Dv2VxgA0"/>

In this class you learn how to import files into an After Effects project with Automation Blocks. We cover both importing individual files and syncing entire system folders with project bins.


### Class 5: Creating Comps and Guides

<Youtube id="JtSuA_o9HlE"/>

In this class you learn how to create new compositions in After Effects with Automation Blocks and also how to add guides to comps. We also cover how to do mathematical calculations and how to retrieve attributes of compositions - as an example for this we first retrieve the width of a composition and then divide it by two, in order to place a guide exactly in the middle of that composition.

### Class 6: Creating Shapes

<Youtube id="oZl_Gz5zwXo"/>

In this class you learn how to create solid layers and shape layers with Automation Blocks. While solids can be created with a single block, for shape layers you have to first create the layer itself and then add its contents step by step, which consists of groups, shape paths, fills, strokes etc. This modular approach allows you to also create shape layers with complex content.

### Class 7: Getting Help, Links and Sharing With the Community

<Youtube id="aT44jURnuMQ"/>

Amazing - you are almost done with this course! Last but not least, in this class you learn how to [ask the community for help](intro.mdx#join-the-community), it you have any questions while you create your own Automation Block scripts. You also learn how to add comments and web links to your scripts and how to share them in our community library.
