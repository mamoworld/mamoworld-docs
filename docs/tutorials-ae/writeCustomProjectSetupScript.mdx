# Write Your Custom Project Setup Script

### Part 1: Getting Started and Creating Project Bins

In this class we get started with writing our own Automation Blocks scripts. We'll write a script that creates a new Ae project and some project bins, as well as giving a quick overview of the available blocks and learn where to find their documentation.

### Part 2: Basic UI and Creating a Folder Structure

In this class, we extend our script so that it prompts the user for a project name. The script then saves the project using that name, and also sets up a folder structure for us.
On the technical side, you'll learn how to work with texts, file paths and also how to use variables.



TODO
- Create project bins "footage" and "precomps"
- save project name in variable NAME
- create comp with come name = NAME
- save project as ~/Documents/Ae Projects/NAME/NAME.aep
- import footage folder ~/Documents/mamoworld/assets
- insert mamoworld icon into the top right corner of a comp

--> cover lots of functionality without using complex concepts like loops, functions or conditionals
