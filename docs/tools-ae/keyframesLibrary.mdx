# Keyframes Library

Automation Blocks contains an entire collection of scripts to simplify the work with keyframes.

## Save Preset

You can use this script to save keyframe presets to your Automation Blocks Keyframes Library.
It will save all keyframes from the currently selected properties.

Just execute the following script:

-   **Keyframes Library - Save Preset**

When you execute the script, a dialog pops up where you can set the name of the preset that will be saved:

<RetinaImg
	src="/img/tools-ae/keyframesLibrarySavePresetDialog.png"
	alt="After Effects Script: Keyframes Library - Save Preset - Dialog"
/>

:::danger Selection

Make sure you have at least one property that has keyframes selected.

:::

## Load Preset

You can use this script to load keyframe presets from your Automation Blocks Keyframes Library.

Just execute the following script:

-   **Keyframes Library - Load Preset**

It will load all keyframes from the selected preset to: all layers, selected layers or selected properties
When you execute the script, a dialog pops up where you can selects the preset that will be applied and to which layers/properties.

<RetinaImg
	src="/img/tools-ae/keyframesLibraryLoadPresetDialog.png"
	alt="After Effects Script: Keyframes Library - Save Preset - Dialog"
/>

If you are targeting the preset to multiple layers/properties the keyframes will be applied to every property that matches the property the keyframes were saved from.

For example, a preset that was saved from the Transform/Opacity property will be pasted into every Transform/Opacity property within the targeted layers/properties.

Selection when preset was created:

<RetinaImg
	src="/img/tools-ae/keyframesLibraryMultiplePropsSelected.png"
	alt="After Effects Script: Keyframes Library - Multiple properties selected"
/>

Loaded preset result:

<RetinaImg
	src="/img/tools-ae/keyframesLibraryLoadToMultipleProps.png"
	alt="After Effects Script: Keyframes Library - Keyframes loaded to multiple properties"
/>
