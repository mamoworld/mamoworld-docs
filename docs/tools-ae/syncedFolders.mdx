# Synced Folders

Automation Blocks contains an entire collection of scripts to simplify synchronizing your system folders with your After Effects folders.

## Import {#Import}

You can use this script to create an After Effects folder with the same name as the system folder you selected and synchronize their contents.
After that you can use the Update script to update the After Effects folder contents whenever you change something in your system folder.

:::tip Folder Location

If you selected an After Effects folder before running the script the new folder will be created inside that folder.
Otherwise it is created in the root of your project.
