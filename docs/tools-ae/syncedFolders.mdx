# Synced Folders

Automation Blocks contains some tools to synchronize system directories with project bins, which you'll find in the section *Project->Footage->Synced Folders* of the library. The basic workflow is:

1. Import entire folders into the After Effects project with the tool **Synced Folders - Import**.
2. After you've added new assets to a synced folder, just run the tool **Synced Folders - Update**. It will detect all changes in any of the synced folders, import all new assets, and also delete project items of assets that have been deleted.

## Import {#Import}

Use this script to create an After Effects folder with the same name as the system folder you've selected and synchronize their contents.

:::tip Folder Location

If you selected an After Effects folder before running the script, the new folder will be created inside that folder.
Otherwise, it is created in the root of your project.
