# Rigs & Presets

## Auto Resizing Text Box {#AutoResizingTextBox}

If you run the **Auto Resizing Text Box Rig** tool, it will create a box around each currently selected text layer:

<Anigif src={useBaseUrl('/img/tools-ae/rigAutoResizingTextBox.gif')} width="865px" />

The box is created with effects and expressions on the layer itself. It will update its size instantly, when the text of the layer is changed. In case you want to delete the box later, just delete the effects on the text layer.

If you want to create more complex dynamic layouts - like a box around multiple layers - take a look at our After Effects extension [Pins & Boxes](https://aescripts.com/pins-and-boxes/)

### Create Your Own Preset Rigs

The block code of the *Auto Resizing Text Box Rig* tool consists of just this single line:

<RetinaImg src="/img/tools-ae/rigAutoResizingTextBoxCode.png" alt="Apply Preset with Automation Blocks"/>

All that this code does is to apply an After Effects preset named *"Text Box Rig.ffx"* to all selected text layers. If you have other After Effects presets and want to create Automation Blocks tools to apply those, just choose a different preset file in the block code and choose the layers to which the preset should be applied.

For more details see the [Apply Preset](/block-reference/aeLayer#ae_layer_apply_preset) block.

## Time-remapping properties {#TimeRemapProperties}

Repeating or retiming an animation is usually very tedious, if the animation includes keyframes on many different properties. The **Time-Remap Selected Properties With a Slider** tool allows you to connect such an animation to a single slider. 

<Anigif src={useBaseUrl('/img/tools-ae/rigTimeRemapProperties.gif')} width="300px" />

The slider is like a playback control for the animation: To play the animation, just keyframe the slider from 0 to 100%. The result is very similar to precomposing an animation and time-remapping the precomp, but the big advantage is that you don't need to create a precomp.

### Overview

### Clean & Simple

The created rig is very light-weight: There are no extra layers, no precomposing etc. The only things that the tool creates are
 - the slider, which you use to control the animation and 
 - expressions on the keyframed properties, which should react to the slider.

### Adding More Properties Later

If you already created a rig and want to add more keyframed properties later, just select those properties and run the tool again. In the dialog which asks for the slider name, make sure to enter the same name that you used before (unless those new properties should be controlled by a different slider).


### Time-Remapping Multiple Animations

The Automation Blocks tool **Time-Remap Selected Properties With a Multiple Animations** is very similar to the basic variant of the tool, except that it uses two sliders in order to handle multiple animations. As in the basic variant the first slider controls the playback of the animation. The second slider allows to pick which of the animations should be played:

<Anigif src={useBaseUrl('/img/tools-ae/rigTimeRemapPropertiesMulti.gif')} width="540px" />

The workflow with this tool for multiple animations is exactly identical, except that before running the tool you need to create some markers on the layer to indicate, which keyframes should belong to which animation. Just create one layer marker for each animation and set the duration of the marker to the duration of the respective animation:
<RetinaImg src="/img/tools-ae/rigTimeRemapPropertiesMultiMarkers.png" alt="use markers to indicate which keyframes belong to which animation"/>

The following tutorial shows the workflow in full detail:

## Import File, Apply Preset & Blending Mode {#importFileApplyPresetBlendingMode}

Do you have some favorite texture or other footage that you are using all the time? Now you can do this in a single click:

- import the footage file into your project if it has not been imported before
- create a new layer with the file in the active comp
- set a blending mode of your choice for the layer
- apply any Ae preset to the layer (to apply effects, expressions and keyframes to it, for example)

Consider this tool as a template to create your custom tool. The main part of the code consists of a single block, where you can choose the texture image, preset and blending mode easily. 

<RetinaImg src="/img/tools-ae/rigImportFileApplyPresetParameters.png" alt="Create a custom texture tool"/>

To create a custom tool for your favorite texture, just change those values as desired and save the block script in your user library.

## Repeat Animation on Selected Layers {#RepeatAnimationSelectedLayers}

This tool allows to apply keyframes to many layers repeatedly. By default, the tool applies a step by step move downwards, but you can also use your own custom keyframes. On the left, you see the result with the default keyframes and on the right with custom keyframes:

<Anigif src={useBaseUrl('/img/tools-ae/rigRepeatKeyframesExamples.gif')} width="300px" />

If you want to use a custom sequence of keyframes, you need to first load those keyframes into the tool and then apply it to your target layers:

<RetinaImg src="/img/tools-ae/rigRepeatKeyframesTimeline.png" alt="repeat keyframes"/>

The tool then pastes the loaded keyframes on all selected layers repeatedly. But in contrast to a normal cut & paste operation, the tool adjusts the pasted animation as needed, such that it continues seamlessly from the location where the layer currently is. Also, a *probability* parameter allows to skip the animation from time to time randomly, to create more variation.

### Loading Keyframes and Adjusting Parameters

To load keyframes into the tool or adjust any of the parameters, you need to edit the block code: 

<RetinaImg src="/img/tools-ae/rigRepeatKeyframesBlockParams.png" alt="customize code of repeat animation tool"/>

To load custom keyframes, just select the property with those keyframes and then click the refresh button on the two first parameters of the block. The first parameter stores the actual keyframe data and the second one the property to which the keyframes should be applied (the tool does not only support position animations, but actually keyframes on any properties).

### Expression

The last parameter of the block code is an expression that is applied on top of the pasted keyframes. By default, this expression makes sure that if a layer moves outside the comp, it appears at the other side again. If you don't want that, you can simply delete the expression parameter. If you want to use your own expression, you can right click on the expression parameter and choose *expand*, to edit the code of the expression.

### Detailed Tutorial

This detailed tutorial explains in full detail how to use and customize the tool. It also includes some advanced tricks, like using keyframes on multiple properties of the layer.

:::danger Preserving Position of Layers

The tool adjusts the keyframes before pasting them to make sure the animations start at the current position of the layer. However, this is only the case, if the properties have at least one keyframe at or before the start of the workarea. Hence, if your layers don't have any keyframes, yet, add a keyframe at the beginning of the workarea before running the tool.
