# Comp Duplicates from Spreadsheet

## Overview

<RetinaImg src="/img/tools-ae/compSpreadsheetWorkflowTitle.png" alt=""/>

 You need to create 100 duplictes of composition in After Effects and customize texts, videos, images, colors, etc in each of them?

 Automation Blocks includes a very efficient workflow to create custom comp duplicates based on a spreadsheet in three steps:

 1. annotate in your composition (and precomps) everything that should be customized
 2. run the script **export spreadsheet from template comp** which generates a spreadsheet based on your annotations
 3. after you filled the spreadsheet with data, run the script **create comp duplicates from spreadsheet**, which creates one copy of the comp for each row of the spreadsheet.

## Usage

### Step 1: Annotate Comp

First, in the composition which you want to duplicate (and any precomps) you need to anotated everything, which you want to customize with the spreadsheet. In a nutshell, you just put a `$` followed by the name or number of a spreadsheet column at the beginning of the name of everything that should show up in the spreadsheet:

:::danger space behind $ annotation

Make sure to keep a space or nother non-letter symbol after the $ annotation.
Names `$A My Text` and `$A-My Text` are ok, but a name `$AMy Text` is interpreted as spreadsheet column `AMY` and not as spreadsheet column `A`.

:::

Instead of letters `$A`, `$B`,... you can also use numbers `$1`, `$2`,...

Here is an overview of everything that can be annotated.

#### texts

To add the text of a text layer to the spreadsheet, just put `$A` at the beginning of the name of the text layer.

#### footage files

To add the source file of a image/video/audio layer to the spreadsheet, just put `$A` at the beginning of the name of the layer.
The spreadsheet will contain only the file name without the path. The other files that this file should be replaced by, must be located in the same folder of your hard-drive. The **create comp duplicates from spreadsheet** will import these files into your project when needed, but will also detect if they are already imported, such that they are not imported a second time.

#### properties (sliders, colors, etc)

You can customize properties like effect controls, layer transforms etc. But since those elements cannot be renamed directly (you cannot rename the `Position` of a layer to `$C Position`, for example), Automation Blocks uses a little workaround:

After Effects has a category of Effects called *Expression Controls*. These effects just contain a single property - like a slider, a color picker, a point control etc. And since those effects (as any effect) can be renamed, Automation Blocks looks for $ annotations on these expression controls. Hence, if you need a slider value in your spreadsheet, for example, you need to: 

1. Create a slider control effect from the *Expression Controls* category
2. Pick-whip the properties that you want to control to this slider (i.e. create an expression link that connects the property that you actually want to control to this slider)
3. Change the name of the slider control effect such that it starts with an annotation like  `$A`.

This approach does not only work with sliders, but with all kinds of expression controls.
#### comp names

You can also control the names of the comp duplicates. Here you can insert the $ annotation not only at the beginning, but anywhere in the comp name and you can also have multiple of them. If your comp name is `video $A with $C`, then both the content of column A and C is inserted in the comp name at the locations where the placeholders `$A` and `$C` are, respectively.
Of course, also the names of precomps may inculde such placeholders.


:::tip Reusing the same placeholder multiple times

You can use the same placeholder multiple times. If the content of column D should be used in both the comp name and the text of a text layer, for example, simply use `$D` in both of them.

:::


#### Locking Precomp Layers

If you don't want a particular precomp to be duplicated, you can simply lock the precomp layer.

### Step 2: Export Spreadsheet

After you did all annotations, make sure the  active composition is the main composition of your template and then run the script **export spreadsheet from template comp**. It first asks where to save the spreadsheet (choose a filename ending with `.csv`) and then creates a spreadsheet based on the annotations you did. If the template comp (or any precomp) contains a text layer with name `$A Dog Name` and text `Daisy`, for example, the column A will have the title `Dog Name` and a first entry with text `Daisy` is placed below it.

You can open this spreadsheet in the spreadsheet app of your choice (Excel, Apple Numbers, Open Office, Google Docs) and add the data for all the comp variants you want to create:

### Step 3: Import Spreadsheet 

After you filled the spreadsheet with data, save it and make sure to keep the format as `.csv`.
Now make sure the active composition is the main composition of your template and then run the Automation Blocks script **create comp duplicates from spreadsheet**. In the dialog that pops up, choose the spreadsheet file and then the script creates one duplicate of the comp (and precomps) for each row of the spreadsheet.

### Comp Duplicator

If you want to just create a duplicate of a composition including all precomps, but don't want to customize anything in the duplicate, you can use the Automation Blocks script "Comp Duplicator" instead.

### Import/Export Texts from Spreadsheet

If you just want to replace texts in a composition the [Text from/to Spreadsheet](textFromToSpreadsheet) tools are also an alternative.
