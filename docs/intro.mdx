# Getting Started

Automation Blocks is an infinite collection of premade one-click tools for any task. It's currently available for Adobe After Effects, but we're also developing a version for Premiere Pro, and you'll already find some info about the Premiere Pro version in this documentation.

**TODO PROMO VIDEO**

## The Tools 

To give you an idea of what Automation Blocks is capable of, here are some examples of tools that are included in the library.

<div style={{display:"flex", "flex-wrap": "wrap", "gap":"40px"}}>

<ToolTeaserBox src="/img/overview/toolTeaserCompSpreadsheet.png" link="/tools-ae/compDuplicatesFromSpreadsheet" title="Comp Duplicates From Spreadsheet" description="Batch replace text, footage, colors and other properties based on a spreadsheet." />

## Use the Existing Tools

Automation Blocks comes with many ready to use tools, which are all listed in the library panel.
If you hover over any of the tools in the library, a short description is shown, which will give you a good idea what the tool is actually doing:

<RetinaImg src="/img/overview/toolsHelpAndHelpTip.png" alt="help in the Automation Blocks library"/>

Some tools are so easy that this short description is really all you need. But some of the more comprehensive tools also come with more documentation. To see it, just select a tool in the library, then click the "Help" button in the top right corner to open the in-depth documentation. You'll find all of these in-depth documentations in the section [Ae Tools](tools-ae/overviewToolsAe).

Most tools in Automation Blocks come with a user interface, which pops up when you run the tool. If a tool comes with a UI, this is indicated with a little dialog icon before the name of the tool:

<RetinaImg src="/img/overview/libraryUiIconExplanation.png" alt="icon indicating that tool has a user interface"/>

If a tool has no user interface, it usually means that it performs its job without the need for any further input. In some rare cases, a tool expects you to modify the block code before using it (like connecting a particular layer property to a block). However, in these rare cases, this is clearly described in the tool help.

## Customize & Write Your Own Tools

In Automation Blocks, you can fully customize all the tools, and even create your own! Instead of programming code, the tools are based on blocks - creating tools feels more like playing with Lego bricks than doing actual programming. It's when you start to customize the example scripts to what you need, or even write your own scripts from scratch, that the magic really begins!
