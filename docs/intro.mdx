# Getting Started

Automation Blocks is an infinite collection of premade one-click tools for any task. Currently it is available for Adobe After Effects, but we also develop a version for Premiere Pro and you find some infos about the Premiere Pro version already in this documentation.

**TODO PROMO VIDEO**

## The Tools 

To give you an idea, what Automation Blocks is capable of, here are some examples of tools, which are included in the library.

<div style={{display:"flex", "flex-wrap": "wrap", "gap":"40px"}}>

<ToolTeaserBox src="/img/overview/toolTeaserCompSpreadsheet.png" link="/tools-ae/compDuplicatesFromSpreadsheet" title="Comp Duplicates From Spreadsheet" description="Batch replace text, footage, colors and other properties based on a spreadsheet." />

## First Steps

## Use the Existing Tools

Automation Blocks comes with many ready to use tools, which are all listed in the library panel.
If you hover over any of the tools in the library, a short description is shown, which gives you a good idea what to tool is actually doing:

<RetinaImg src="/img/overview/toolsHelpAndHelpTip.png" alt="help in the Automation Blocks library"/>

Some tools are so easy that this short description is really all you need. But some more comprehensive tools also come with an in-depth documentation. Just select a tool in the library and then click the "Help" button in the top right corner to open this in-depth documentation. You find all those in-depth documentations in the section [Ae Tools](tools-ae/overviewToolsAe).

Most tools of Automation Blocks come with a user interface, which pops up when you run the tool. If a tool comes with a UI, this is indicated with a little dialog icon before the name of the tool:

<RetinaImg src="/img/overview/libraryUiIconExplanation.png" alt="icon indicating that tool has a user interface"/>

If a tool has no user interface, it usually means that it performs its job without the need for any further input. In some rare cases, a tool expects you to modify the block code before using it (like connecting a particular layer property to a block). But in those rare cases, this is described clearly in the help of the tool.

Just download the folder right into your Automation Blocks user library, restart Automation Blocks and you are ready to go.

If you created a script that might be useful for the community, please [get in touch with us :-)](mailto:info@mamoworld.com). If you are using GitHub, you can also create a pull request.

## Customize & Write Your Own Tools

In Automation Blocks, you can fully customize all tools and even create your own ones! Instead of programming code, the tools are based on blocks. Therefore, creating the tools feels more like playing with Lego bricks than doing actual programming. Once you start to customize the example scripts to your needs, or even write your own scripts from scratch - this is where the true magic happens! 

To best place to get started with writing your own block scripts in After Effects are the tutorial series [Write Your Custom Project Setup Script](tutorials-ae/writeCustomProjectSetupScript) and [Write Your Custom Template Tool](tutorials-ae/writeCustomTemplateTool).
