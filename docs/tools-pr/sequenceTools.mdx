# Sequence Tools

## Deep Duplicate Sequence {#duplicate_active_sequence_including_nested_sequences}

### Usage

When you duplicate a sequence in Premiere Pro, which contains nested sequences, those nested sequences are not duplicated, which can cause a lot of confusion and frustration. With the Automation Blocks tool **Duplicate Active Sequence Including Nested Sequences** you create a duplicate of the active sequence and all nested sequences easily. Just choose a name for the duplicate and a bin where it should be placed and run the tool:
<RetinaImg src="/img/tools-pr/sequenceTools/duplicateActiveSequenceToolUI.png" alt="Premiere Pro tool to duplicate the active sequence including nested sequences"/>

**Extra tip**: In the parameter "name of duplicate" you can use the placeholder $1 for the name of the active sequence.

### Customizing the Block Code

This tool effectively just wraps a user interface around the [Clone Sequence Block](../block-reference/prSequence#block_pr_sequence_clone).
The first four blocks create the user interface. Here you can easily adjust the default values for the different inputs, for example.

<RetinaImg src="/img/tools-pr/sequenceTools/duplicateActiveSequenceToolBlocks.png" alt="customizing the block code"/>

## Set In Out Range {#sequence_set_in_out_range}

Automation Blocks contains two tools to sett the In-Out-Range of the active sequence:

- **Set In Out to Selected Clips**
- **Set In Out to Full Duration**

<RetinaImg src="/img/tools-pr/sequenceTools/setInOutRangeToSelectedClips.png" alt="Premiere Pro tool to duplicate the active sequence including nested sequences"/>

The two tools have no user interface - just select one of them, run it and you are done.
