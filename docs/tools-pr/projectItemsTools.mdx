The tool "Move Used Clips to Sub-bin" is designed to automatically relocate all clips that have already been used in the timeline into a dedicated sub-bin.

### Organize Clips by Rating in Bins

In Premiere Pro, you have the ability to assign ratings to clips on a scale of zero to five stars. To make the most of this feature, Automation Blocks offers a tool to automatically sort clips into sub-bins based on their ratings. This means that you can easily group all your five-star clips into a single bin, simplifying your project organization.

## Deleting Items


### Remove Unused Footage 

Deleting unused footage items from your Premiere Pro project is a breeze with the built-in menu command, "Edit->Remove Unused." However, Automation Blocks takes it a step further with the "Delete Unused Footage Items" tool, offering additional advantages:

- **Selective Processing**: This tool allows you to target specific items, enabling you to remove only the unused clips from a particular bin, for instance.

- **Detailed Console Output**: Gain complete visibility into the removal process with a comprehensive console output that precisely outlines which clips have been deleted.

As a bonus, our tutorial provides insights into customizing the tool's block code, so you can create a list of unused footage without actually removing it, tailoring the tool to your unique requirements.

### Remove Empty Bins

When you execute the menu command "Edit->Remove Unused" in Premiere Pro, the application diligently removes everything that isn't used in your timelineâ€”almost everything. It conveniently leaves behind empty bins, which may clutter your project.

Fortunately, Automation Blocks introduces the "Delete Empty Project Bins" tool to address this oversight. This smart tool goes a step further by eliminating not only empty bins but also bins that solely contain other empty bins, ensuring your project remains clutter-free and well-organized.
